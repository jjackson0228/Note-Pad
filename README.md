# Note-Pad

## Description

This application is a clean and useful way to take notes. It's fast, easy, and most importantly user friendly. The user can add a note by clicking on the left side of the note pad and add a note with a title and then the content of the note. Then the user can save the note. The note pad saves the note on the left side but only shows the title. Click on the title to see the full note. Also added functionality to delete notes, so the user can keep up with their notes quickly and efficiently.
